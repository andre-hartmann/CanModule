# CanModule
Can Module, previously known as Common CAN Component is a library developed in a collaborative effort between ATLAS and BE-ICS-CIC, and it is intended to be used as an optional reusable component inside the QUASAR framework (Although it can also live outside of QUASAR). The purpose of the library is to be able to control any kind of CAN device in a highly flexible, multi platform way (note: plug-in libraries may be required for new device types) both from Windows and Linux. At time of writing, Systec, Peak and Anagate are supported on windows, whereas on Linux, anagate native driver is supported, and any device types with a socketCAN driver should work. Further hardware support will be added in the future on an as needs basis.
